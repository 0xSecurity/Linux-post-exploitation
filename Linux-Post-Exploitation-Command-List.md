## Collecting Information

<a name="blind_files"/>
### Blind Files
things to pull when all you can do is blindly read like in LFI/dir traversal (Don’t forget %00!)

| File                      | Contents and Reason                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------  |
| /etc/resolv.conf          | Contains the current name servers (DNS) for the system. This is a globally readable file that is less likely to trigger IDS alerts than /etc/passwd |
| /etc/motd                 | Message of the Day                                |
| /etc/issue	            | current version of distro                         |
| /etc/passwd	            | List of local users                               |
| /etc/shadow	            | List of users’ passwords’ hashes (requires root)  |
| /home/xxx/.bash_history   | Will give you some directory context              |
