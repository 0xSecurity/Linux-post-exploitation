== Cain and Abel

Cain doesn't support importing of cached credentials so in order to do so you
 need to close Cain and edit the CACHE.LST file which resides in the
 installation directory for CAIN. Once there simply put your hashes in this
 format:

{{{DOMAIN<TAB>USERNAME<TAB><TAB>HASH<TAB><TAB>}}}

Where DOMAIN, USERNAME and HASH are subsituted for the details and tabs
are typed.
