### Blind files
things to pull when all you can do is blindly read like in LFI/dir traversal (Don’t forget %00!)

| File                      | Contents and Reason                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| /etc/resolv.conf          | Contains the current name servers (DNS) for the system. This is a globally readable file that is less likely to trigger IDS alerts than /etc/passwd |
| /etc/motd                 | Message of the Day                               |
| /etc/issue	            | current version of distro                        |
| /etc/passwd	            | List of local users                              |
| /etc/shadow	            | List of users’ passwords’ hashes (requires root) |
| /home/xxx/.bash_history   | Will give you some directory context             |
